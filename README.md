# Neural-Network
My attempt at a neural network implemented in python with no external libraries and built from scratch (with the exception of numpy)


# Update Log 4 - 30 December 2024 (Happy New Year!)
1. Added Error Term Matrix to Layer class

# Update Log 4 - 28 December 2024
1. Updated Specificity of Recieving Input Neuron Layer

# Update Log 3 - 12 November 2024
1. Removed Backpropagation Logic

# Update Log 2 - 8 November 2024
1. Fixed Parameter passed in softmax function: output_layer

# Update Log 1 - 2 November 2024
1. Fixed out of bounds error in the creation of the array
2. Changed the logic of the instantiation of the Network class
3. Introduced a Settings.py which serves as a file that contains static variables to decouple the logic and tuning of the neural network.
4. Added Input and Output Layer to layer array.
