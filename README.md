# Neural-Network
My attempt at a neural network implemented in python with no external libraries and built from scratch (with the exception of numpy)



# Update Log 2 - 8 November 2024
1. Fixed Parameter passed in softmax function: output_layer
2. 

# Update Log 1 - 2 November 2024
1. Fixed out of bounds error in the creation of the array
2. Changed the logic of the instantiation of the Network class
3. Introduced a Settings.py which serves as a file that contains static variables to decouple the logic and tuning of the neural network.
4. Added Input and Output Layer to layer array.
